# Advent of Code

This repository is dedicated to Advent of Code. I first attended the contest in 2022 (I didn't know about it until then) and I fell in love with it from that point on. I made it a mission to solve all problems from all contests. Here I will store all solutions for every problem, as well as any other helpers that make my life easier for competing.

To help navigate, I currently have:

-   `advent-of-code-xxx` folders: solutions to the respective year
-   [`aocommon`](./aocommon/): common utilities, such as a script for automatically creating a problem folder for a given year and day, with that problem's title and some boilerplate code
-   [`golib`](./golib/): go libraries to store common code I found myself repeating a lot during the contest
-   [`test-get-dates-script`](./test-get-dates-script/): some tests I've been doing

See you during the contest!
