# Go libraries

Contains code and functionality that I found myself re-writing during the Advent of Code contests. May also include general helper data structures for solving these problems.

> Note: even though packages from here could theoretically be imported in other projects, I'm not treating them as [public packages](https://go.dev/doc/modules/developing) that I'm actively maintaining. I mostly plan to import them locally in my Avent of Code solutions. I won't be versioning anything or follow any standard practices.

In fact, for that very reason, I eventually went with simply having a go module at the root of this repository, whick makes it really easy to import these packages in the subfolders.
